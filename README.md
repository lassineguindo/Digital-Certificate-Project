# Digital-Certificate-Project

## Project Overview
This project explores **digital certificates**, their importance in securing online communications, and how to **view, verify, and manage certificates** using Google Chrome, Windows Certificate Manager, and Microsoft Edge.

## Project Contents
The project consists of three main tasks:

1. **Viewing Digital Certificates**
   - Examining website certificates in **Google Chrome**
   - Understanding certificate details, expiration dates, and security mechanisms
   - Exploring encryption with **public and private keys**

2. **Viewing Digital Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) & Untrusted Certificates**
   - Using **Windows Certificate Manager** (`certmgr.msc`)
   - Identifying **trusted and untrusted** certificates
   - Understanding reasons for certificate revocation

3. **Downloading & Installing a Digital Certificate**
   - Creating an account on **Actalis SSL**
   - Retrieving and verifying a certificate
   - Configuring **S/MIME** for secure email communication

## Key Learnings
- **Why HTTPS is enforced** even if users donâ€™t type it manually
- **How certificates secure websites** and encrypt communications
- **The role of Certificate Authorities (CAs)** in verifying trust
- **How revoked or untrusted certificates affect security**
- **Steps to manually install and configure a digital certificate**

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Google Chrome** (Developer Tools for security analysis)
- **Windows Certificate Manager** (`certmgr.msc`)
- **Microsoft Edge** (Downloading & installing digital certificates)
- **Actalis SSL** (Obtaining a free email certificate)
- **S/MIME** (Secure email communication setup)

## My Contribution
Ihis was an **individual project**, and I completed:
- **Analyzing HTTPS enforcement and encryption**
- **Investigating certificate details (Steps 1-12)**
- **Exploring certificate revocation and security risks**
- **Installing and configuring a digital certificate for email security**

## Future Enhancements
- Exploring **self-signed certificates** and their risks
- Implementing **automated certificate validation** in scripts
- Investigating **real-world cases of certificate misuse**
